# 🎬 OTT Audience Map for SNU Film Fest  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** to cluster SNU students based on their viewing preferences.  
By analyzing **movie genres, series genres, OTT platforms, and content languages**, we uncover natural audience segments that can guide film screenings and OTT partnerships for the annual SNU Film Fest.

## 🛠️ Methods  
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized column names, removed extra spaces, handled missing values.  
- **Feature Encoding**: Converted categorical data into numerical format using Label Encoding.  
- **Clustering Algorithm**: Applied **K-Means** clustering.  
- **Cluster Evaluation**:  
  - *Inertia (Elbow Method)* – to determine optimal clusters.  
  - *Silhouette Score* – to measure cluster quality.  
- **Visualization**: 3D cluster scatter plots using Matplotlib.

## 📊 Results  
- Optimal number of clusters: **4**.  
- Identified distinct audience groups (e.g., Bollywood lovers, regional content fans, global OTT users).  
- **Visualized 3D clusters** to interpret group separation.
